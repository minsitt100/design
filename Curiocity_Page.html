                Curiosity is a new, purpose-driven platform focused on helping analysts organize their research material more effectively, with less effort,

            <p class="ProblemSummary">
                Currently, financial analysts face the challenge of managing a vast amount of reference material for report writing, 
                with each report involving between 50 and 500 documents and 20 to 100 URLs. They rely on browser bookmarks and Excel files to track these resources, 
                which proves to be time-consuming and inefficient. Labeling, sorting, and organizing these materials creates significant overhead, detracting from their core work. 
            <p class = "ProblemSummary">Thus, there is a need for <strong style="color: #64516E;">a cohesive, integrated tool that can streamline the extraction and management of details </strong>,
