              Curiocity is a fintech startup in the pre-product stage.  Curiocity aims to enhance the workflow of financial analysts, or anyone engaged in extensive 
              research and report writing, by integrating resource storage and report creation into a single screen. This eliminates the need for multiple screens—one for writing and another for organizing resources—creating a 
              more efficient research experience.
            </p>
            <p class ="ContextSummary">
              I joined as a Product Management and Design intern and was responsible for the strategy and design of their MVP, which would be showcased to potential investors and users.

        <div class = "Problem">

            <p class = "ProblemSummary">
              The current research and workflow process for financial analysts are inefficient, often involving constant back-and-forth between resource organization and report writing.
            </p>
            <p class="ProblemSummary">
                Financial analysts manage a vast amount of reference material for report writing, 
                with each report involving between 50 and 500 documents and 20 to 100 URLs. They rely on browser bookmarks and Excel files to track these resources, 
                which proves to be time-consuming and inefficient. Labeling, sorting, and organizing these materials creates significant overhead, detracting from their core work. 
            <p class = "ProblemSummary">Thus, there is a need for <strong style="color: #64516E;">a cohesive, integrated tool that can streamline the extraction and management of details </strong>,

            <p class = "ResearchSummary">
              I spent a month exploring different directions to identify Curiocity’s ideal customer segment. 
              We began by interviewing 10 analysts from marketing, finance, and strategy to better understand their research processes. 
              If these analysts shared similar workflows and pain points, Curiocity could address a broader range of customer challenges, rather than 
              focusing solely on financial analysts as initially planned.
            </p>
            <p class = "ResearchSummary">
              Below are some high level findings:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li class="list-item ResearchSummary"><strong>Analysts want to streamline research and source validation:</strong> They face challenges with 
                managing their documents and finding them when necessary. 
              </li>
              <li class="list-item ResearchSummary"><strong>Analysts want to enhance report writing efficiency:</strong> Analysts often struggle with creating comprehensive,
                 well-structured reports from extensive research, and would wnat tools that help with template, summarization to 
                 produce polish reports more quickly. 
              </li>
              <li class="list-item ResearchSummary"><strong>Analysts often use multiple tools to achieve their current workflows: </strong> Commonly noted was Google Docs, Notion, GDrive, Notes, etc. 
                One tool for report writing, one tool for keeping track of sources. 
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p class = "ResearchSummary">
              Our initial interviews with analysts validated Curiocity’s value proposition of integrating report writing and file organization into a single platform. 
              I also identified significant potential to address additional pain points, such as article summarization, to create a seamless research experience.

            <p class = "ResearchSummary">
              By this point, my lead desinger Will had already worked on some initial desgins prior to me joining the project. His designs were 
              based on similar projects he has done and concepts provided by the CEO. I'm showing them here to provide clairty on the whole journey as I was responsible for improving upon them:

            <p class = "ResearchSummary">
              Will and I decided against this version because it felt too complex. The report-writing section (left-hand side) was envisioned like building website blocks, where users could add new text blocks as needed for writing paragraphs. The left-hand side also displayed summaries generated by an AI model after a user uploaded a file. However, we felt the layout could be improved for better intuitiveness. 
              The design seemed overwhelming with too many features and lacked a clean, streamlined look.
            </p>
            <p class = "ResearchSummary">
              Will and I also got together to outline the user journey to 
              connect all the features we had in mind together for our next iteration of designs.

          <p class = "MidFidelityTitle">Redesigning Curiocity for a Cleaner, Intuitive Experience</p>
            <p class = "MidFidelitySummary">
              In redesigning the report writing section, I aimed to create an intuitive experience by aligning the layout with tools analysts were already familiar with. From our interviews, we noticed that many analysts frequently used platforms like Google Docs, so we incorporated similar design elements to streamline the user experience. 
              For instance, the homepage is reminesence Google Docs’ starting interface, making it easy for users to navigate from the get-go. Additionally, we included all the essential functionalities of typical report-writing software, with the ability to export reports when completed. By keeping the interface familiar, 
              I ensured that users could seamlessly transition to our platform without a steep learning curve.
            </p>
            <div class = "WireframeImage">

            </div>
            <p class = "MidFidelitySummary">
              On the right-hand side of the interface is the “Drive,” where users can find their folders and files. 
              Similar to the report-writing section, we applied the same logic by designing the file management system to reflect tools users are already familiar with. We incorporated organizational features like tags, filtering, and search functionality to 
              encourage efficient document management. Users can filter, search, and adjust the viewing layout to quickly locate the files they need, all within one centralized space.
               The goal was to make this part of the design familiar while also incorporating tools that simplify the process of finding relevant documents for any given task.
            </p>
            <div class = "WireframeImage">

            </div>
            <p class = "MidFidelitySummary">
             I also desinged screens to address the pain-points regarding efficient summarization of articles and sources analysts ecounter discovered through initial interviews.
              Once a user locates a file in their drive and views it, they will be provided an AI-powered summarization to highlight key insights. I also added an option to toggle between a full document view of the original file based on their needs.
              The platform thus supports a side-by-side view of the report one is writing and supporting files, enabling seamless cross-referencing without the need for multiple tabs. This setup streamlines the research process, keeping all essential tools within a single, organized interface.

            Testing Our New Designs
          </p>
          <p class = "UserInterviewsSummary">
            After completing the high-fidelity prototype, I conducted additional 20 user interviews with analysts to evaluate its accessibility and intuitiveness. My goal was to determine if users could easily perform specific tasks. I asked participants to complete actions like, "Please create a blank new report," while encouraging them to think aloud and explain why they believed their actions would complete the task. 
            When users encountered difficulties, I prompted them to try their next best action and verbalize their reasoning throughout the process.
          </p>
          <p class ="UserInterviewsSummary">
            From these interviews, I identified three recurring design issues:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li class="list-item ResearchSummary"><strong>Navigating from a Report back to the Report Home Page:</strong> I had designed a report icon next to the report's title and prototyped it with the intention that it brings the user back to the report home page, similar to Google Docs.
             However, this was not as inutitivie as I thought it would be for the users. 
            </li>
            <li class="list-item ResearchSummary"><strong>Navigating from an Opened File:</strong> Users struggled to return to the grid layout of files after opening a specific file.
               They found the "Drive" icon unclear, as it did not effectively communicate that an action could be performed.
            </li>
            <li class="list-item ResearchSummary"><strong>Lack of “Light Mode”:
            </strong> Several users expressed a preference for a light mode option. They felt that having the choice between light and dark modes would allow them to tailor the interface to their workflow preferences.
           </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "Iteration">
          <p class = "IterationTitle">
            Iteration
          </p>
          <p class = "IterationSummary">
            Taking into account the feedback, I designed a light mode version of all the screens I made. Here are a couple samples:
          </p>
          <div class = "WireframeImage">
            <img src="assets/Curiocity css/(FP - Light Mode) Expand File View - Document Summary Version.png">

          <div class = "WireframeImage">
            <img src="assets/Curiocity css/(FP - Light Mode) Starting Desktop (Grid View).png">
          </div>
           <p class ="IterationSummary">
            In addition, I changed our report icon to a back arrow design to make it clearer that this would take them back to the report home page. In addition, from the interviews I noticed a majority of the users
            often clicked on the Curiocity logo as a way to get back to the report page, so I added that action in our prototype as well.

            This project was my first experience bringing a vision to life from scratch, and it was incredibly rewarding. 
            Starting with a blank canvas gave me the creative freedom to shape the design from the ground up. It also pushed me to further develop my skills in Figma, especially with advanced features like animations, such as creating a loading screen!
             Working closely with a lead designer was an invaluable part of the process—we collaborated effectively, 
             constantly exchanging feedback, which made identifying and implementing improvements much easier. This project not only strengthened my design skills but also honed my strategic thinking, as I had to balance creativity with functionality. 
             It was an exciting learning experience, and I look forward to applying these lessons to future projects!
