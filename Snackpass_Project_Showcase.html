          <p class = "DesignSolution">I designed the "Favorite Store" feature, enabling users to request points from specific stores for easier gifting and reward redemption. 
            I also enhanced Snackpass's "Chicken Coop" feature by allowing the in-app currency to be used for rewards. 
            Additionally, I introduced "Leaderboards" to rank users by ordering and gifting activity, 
            to create competitiveness and thereby user engagement.

      <div class = "ProblemStatement"> 
        <p class = "ProblemStatementTitle">So.. What is Snackpass?</p>
        <p class = "SnackSummary"> Snackpass is a  social food-pick-up app aimed at university students.</p>

        <p class = "ContextSummary">Users can order ahead for pickup, earn loyalty points for discounts, and gift friends directly through the app. It features exclusive discounts, an activity feed to track friends’ orders and gifts, 
          and various gamification elements to enhance the experience and set it apart from the competition.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "ProblemStatement">
        <p class ="ProblemStatementTitle">Snackpass users have been frustrated with
          the rewards program. </p>
        <p class = "Quote">"Too many orders required to receive free rewards to incentivize me to take advantage of it.” - Surveyed Snackpass User.</p>
        <p class = "SummaryOfProblem">After three years of using Snackpass, I've only managed to claim free rewards once due to the unattainable and slow nature of the current reward system. 
          Consequently, I've found myself using Snackpass less frequently since there's little motivation unless it's purely convenient. 
       <p class ="ProblemStatementTitle">Additionally, some features felt out of place... </p>
        <p class = "Quote">"The Chicken Coop feature feels random and initially confusing in how it relates to the rest of the app.” - Surveyed Snackpass User.</p>
        <p class = "SummaryOfProblem">Chicken Coop is one of Snackpass’s gamification features that sets it apart from your typical food-pick up app.</p>
        <p class = "SummaryOfProblem">The feature is straightforward: by ordering and sending points to friends, users fill a progress bar that eventually hatches a virtual chicken pet. Once hatched, the chicken generates coins that users can use to buy clothing and accessories for the pet.        </p>
        <p class = "SummaryOfProblem">While the feature is cute, that is all it really is. I felt the "Chicken Coop" gamification feature was disconnected from the app's core functions of pick-up and lacks appeal for users like myself who are uninterested in dressing up virtual chickens.
        </p>
        <p class = "ProblemStatementTitle">Thus, I asked:</p>
        <p class = "SnackSummary"> How would I increase accessibility and statisfaction of the rewards system and 
          modify and implement gamification elements to help Snackpass continue to set itself apart?</p>
      </div>
    <div class = "Validation">
        <p class = "ValidationTitle">
          With a problem to solve, I sought user feedback to guide me towards solutions.
        </p>
        <p class = "ValidationSummary">
          Before developing any high-fidelity prototypes, I surveyed 50+ Snackpass users to validate pain-points and solutions I had in mind. 
          The survey aimed at understanding user gifting behavior, perspectives on the attainability of Snackpass's reward system, and engagement with the "Chicken Coop" feature. 
        </p>
        <p class = "ValidationSummary">Below are some main statistics and comments regarding user gifting behavior and the reward system:</p>
        <div class = "Statistics">
          <ul class ="bullet-list">
            <li class = "list-item StatisticsLine"><strong style="color: #04BCFC">58.1%</strong>

              of users said Snackpass only feels slightly social. </li>

              of users said they rarely use the Chicken Coop feature and see no benefit to it. </li>

      </div>
       <p class = "ValidationSummary">From these statistics, I had the following takeaways to guide my solutions:</p>

          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li class ="list-item StatisticsLine">Users prefer earning points from specific stores and like making progress towards them.</li>

              Leaderboards traditionally is an effective gamification feature that makes users competiive by comparing themselevs with others as results are displayed publicly. Users at top rankings 
              are able to feel a sense of accomplishment and recognition from other users, and thus are motivated to keep their ranks. In addition, casual users enjoy looking at leaderboards out of curiosity.</p>
            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              I saw an opportunity to implement this within Snackpass. Imagine seeing your friend on the top leaderboard for ordering 50 bobas within the 
              span of 2 months! You reach out to them--both amazed and also perhaps concerned for their sugar intake. You could also take them up on the challenge and see if you can beat them on the rankings.
            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              This is the goal for the feature:<strong style="color: #04BCFC"> increase engagement and the social aspect of 
              Snackpass by creating conversations between users and providing them more incentives to cotninue using the app. </strong> 
            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              In my design, I've provided the option for rankings under different categories, opening up multiple opportunities for users to rank, compete, and view information.

        <p class = "DesginJustification">
              Design Choices:

            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">Faimiliarity:</strong> I researched how leaderboards were structured in gaming apps which commonly rank player performance amongst
              sets of metrics. Through this, I adjusted the design (Wireframe #1 to Wireframe #2), making it concise and familiar. 
            </p>
            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">Highlighting Top Players: </strong> I wanted top users to be clearly distinct and recognized, and thus applied a different color gradient

            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">Intuitive Placement: </strong> I put "Leaderboards" within the same area as "Trending", a page where users can see 
              what people are currently ordering from restaurants. "Trending" is currently the only page under the "lightning" icon in the app. Thus,
              putting "Leaderboards" under this icon would be intuitive, since both are data-oriented and informational pages.

              Along with the data from the user surveys, I decided to make a mind-map to highlight key pain-points of the Chicken Coop Feature and ideate solutions. 
              Primary pain-points from surveys was the feature <strong style="color:#04BCFC">lacked relevancy</strong> for the rest of the app and there is <strong style="color:#04BCFC"> little incetive for 
                users to interact with the feature.</strong></p>
          <p class = "ChickencoopText">Thus, the following solutions were ideated:</p>
          <p class = "ChickencoopText">1. Link the "Favorite Store" feature to "Chicken Coop" by providing extra progress to hatching chicks if a 
              user gives the points to their friends favorite store.</p>
          <li class ="ReasoningForChickenCoop"><strong style="color:#04BCFC">WHY:</strong> The feature would be connected to a core function of the app: ordering and delivering.</li>
          <p class = "ChickencoopText">2. A new gift-card system called SnackCards that allows users to convert coins 
              collected from chickens into free rewards and discounts.</p>
          <li class ="ReasoningForChickenCoop"><strong style="color:#04BCFC">WHY:</strong> As the currency can only be gained by interacting 
                  with the feature, users are incetivized to use it if they want another method to obtain rewards.</li>
          <p class = "ChickencoopText">3. Leaderboards will have a category for the chicken coop feature such as most chickens hatched. 
          <li class ="ReasoningForChickenCoop"><strong style="color:#04BCFC"> WHY:</strong> To allow users to be recognized for interacting and engaging with the app (since chickens are hatched through orders and gifting through Snackpass) and act as incetives for

          <p class = "ChickencoopText">
            <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">SncakCards:</strong> When designing the SnackCards, I used bright-colors and gradients to maintain the "fun" and "social" brand image
            that Snackpass has established itself with. 
          </p>
          <p class = "ChickencoopText">
            <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">Centralizing Features: </strong> In adjusting the Chicken Coop feature, I redesigned the page to have all related
            functions for the chickens—from collecting coins to shopping for new clothes—all on one page. Users now have access to everything they need front and center rather
            than navigating through different pages.

        This was my first experience in making a personal project and taking control of understanding and designing a product to imrpove it! I had 
        a great learning experience in teaching myself Figma and understanding all the nunances behind the software. I also reseach mobile app design techniques and accesibility concepts
       to make sure that the designs I were making were as feasible as they could be. </p>
      <p class = "ReflectionText">
        An aspect of the project I would have done differently if I had time, is interview more business owners! Users like me are one-side of the coin,
        so I would want to survey restaurant partners with Snackpass how the rewards system affects their business to see if an more effective middle-ground
        can be achieved.
      </p>
      <p class = "ReflectionText">
        Regardless, I am super proud of what I was able to achieve and my ability to learn new techniques and push myself out of my comfort zone. Since this was a personal
        project, I designed all assets and aspects of the project on my own alongst managing my coursework. However, I kept pushing since I know the end-result of redesigning and thinking 
        strategically on how to improve a product I use often is something I can be proud of!
